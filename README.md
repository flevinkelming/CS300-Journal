# CS300 Journal

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

I was tasked with creating a course planner that allows users to load course data, search for specific courses, and view course lists in alphanumeric order. The challenge was to manage and retrieve course information efficiently.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I explored different data structures—vectors, hash tables, and binary trees—to determine which would best balance efficiency in searching, inserting, and maintaining course order. Understanding data structures is key to designing systems that handle large amounts of data effectively.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

When encountering issues, I referred back to the fundamentals of each data structure and tested different implementations. Adjusting my code to handle edge cases, like unbalanced trees, helped me refine the final solution.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project taught me to carefully choose data structures based on the specific needs of a program. I learned to consider both performance and how the structure impacts the ease of implementation and future maintenance.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I now focus on writing clear, modular code that’s easy to understand and modify. I also prioritize choosing data structures that not only solve the problem but also allow for scalability and easy updates in the future.
